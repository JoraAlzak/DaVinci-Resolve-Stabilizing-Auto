# DaVinci-Resolve-Stabilizing-Auto
Simple script. Sets parameters to many clips.


Works with DaVinci Resolve v16 on 4K monitor, v17 full hd monitor and v17 4K monitor.

It was a custom order from one man from USA. 

Programm automating sets parametrs to fields.

Works with <code>PySimpleGui</code>. Because DaVinci api is too short. PyWinAuto was too slow. So it's the best way to create this programm.
