# DaVinci-Resolve-Stabilizing-Auto
Simple script. Sets parameters to many clips.


Works with DaVinci Resolve v16 on 4K monitor, v17 full hd monitor and v17 4K monitor.

It was a custom order from one man from USA. 

Programm automating sets parametrs to fields.

Works with PySimpleGui. Because DaVinci api is too short. PyWinAuto was too slow. So it's the best way to create this programm.
